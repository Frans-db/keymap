# Personal ErgoDone QMK Layout
Layout does not use most keys available on the ergodox, I did this on purpose to make it resemble keyboards like the corne and gergoplex

A lot of inspiration taken from https://github.com/manna-harbour/qmk_firmware/tree/miryoku/users/manna-harbour_miryoku, however I two layers as a toggle instead of having to hold down the key.
